Tribute page for FreeCodeCamp

This is my code for the [Freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) [tribute](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) project.

I wanted to create a tribute for any github user to showcase their hard work.  You can checkout the working code [here](http://timharshman.com/tribute)
